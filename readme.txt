 Requirements:

- python 3
- python libraries
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- re
- urllib
- bs4
- time
- datatime
- sklearn
- xgboost.sklearn

Files:
- ip5001.ipynb is the code to run to generate my final submission 
- mytest.csv is the final prediction results on testing data
- train.csv is the training data
- test.csv is the testset without speed
- hongkong.csv is the weather information of hong kong between 2017 to 2018

Usage:
- Need to connect to the network because crawler is implemented in the code.
- With required packages set down, put all files into one directory, run the code directly from top to bottom.
- It takes some time to finish the whole process, too much calculation, so not that fast.
- After running all the code, you can get the prediction results on testing data, which is the same as my uploaded one
